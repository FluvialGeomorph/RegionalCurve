Description: This package contains data from a broad range of studies that 
    delineate regional hydraulic geometry relationships. These data have been 
    compiled into a single table to provide a comprehensive one-stop source. 
    Accessor functions have also been included to streamline application of 
    dimensions in other analyses.
