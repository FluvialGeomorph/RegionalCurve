Description: Data from studies that delineate regional hydraulic geometry 
    relationships. These data have been compiled from a wide range of studies 
    into a single table to provide a comprehensive one-stop source.  Accessor 
    functions have also been included to streamline the application of 
    dimensions in other analyses and visualizations.
