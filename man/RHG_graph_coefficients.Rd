\usage{
RHG_graph_coefficients(region, drainageArea, dimensionType)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{character; The region that a dimension will be
calculated for. See the regional_curves$region field
for a complete list.}

\item{drainageArea}{numeric; The upstream drainage area of the location of
the dimension (in square miles).}

\item{dimensionType}{character; The dimension type: "area", "depth", "width"}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the value of slope (\eqn{m}) and intercept
    (\eqn{a}) for the requested region and hydraulic dimension.
}
\description{
Computes the regional curve power function coefficients from
    a table of regional hydraulic curve coordinates contained in a built-in
    table.
}
\details{
Regional curves are typically displayed on log-log plots. This
    method is required to extract the formula for calculating the y-axis
    value on these graphs (i.e., cross-sectional area, width, mean depth)
    from the x-axis value (i.e., drainage area). Monomial relationships of
    the form \eqn{y=ax^m}, known as power functions, appear as straight
    lines in a logâ€“log graph, with the exponent (\code{m}) and constant
    (\eqn{a}) term corresponding to slope and intercept of the line
    (\eqn{y = mx + b}).

\examples{
# Calculate the slope and intercept for a watershed with drainage area = 1
# square mile in the Eastern United States region.
RHG_graph_coefficients(region = "Eastern United States",
                       drainageArea = 1,
                       dimensionType = "area")
